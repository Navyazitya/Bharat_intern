## Overview
The project leverages collaborative filtering and content-based algorithms to analyze user preferences and provide tailored movie recommendations. Users can explore recommended movies through the interactive Streamlit app.

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Get movie suggestions based on your interests and viewing history.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Interact with the recommendation system through an intuitive Streamlit app.
- **Data Visualization**: Explore recommendations and user preferences through visualizations.

## Usage
To run the Streamlit app, use the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
The app will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Data Sources
The project uses data from popular movie databases for training the recommendation model. Please refer to the code and documentation for more details on data sources.
